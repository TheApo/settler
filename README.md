# Tiwanaku

**Explore ancient lands and uncover hidden resources through pure logic!**

Tiwanaku is a free, offline logic puzzle game inspired by the mystery of the Andes. It combines the elegance of Sudoku with a fresh twist — pixel-art biomes waiting to be filled, number by number.

## A Unique Logic Puzzle

Each level is a map of biomes — forests, deserts, mountains, oceans — waiting for you to fill with numbers following two simple rules.

### The Rules (Easy to Learn, Hard to Master)

- **Every number in a biome is unique.** A biome with 5 tiles holds the numbers 1 through 5.
- **No two neighboring tiles may share the same value.**

That's it. No tutorial marathon, no overwhelming menus. Tap a tile to set a number, and let your brain do the rest.

### Project Structure

The project is a standard multi-module libGDX setup:

```
settler/
├── core/      # Shared game code (rules, generator, UI, rendering)
├── desktop/   # LWJGL3 launcher (Windows / macOS / Linux)
├── android/   # Android launcher + manifest + resources
├── teavm/     # TeaVM launcher for the HTML5 / web build
├── assets/    # Fonts, images, i18n property files (shared by all platforms)
└── docs/      # Published web build (served as static site)
```

The core module contains the gameplay:

- `com.apogames.settler.game.tiwanaku` — game state, level sizes, main game loop
- `com.apogames.settler.level.algorithmX` — puzzle generation / uniqueness solver
- `com.apogames.settler.game.menu` — menus and navigation
- `com.apogames.settler.asset` / `common` / `entity` — assets, helpers, entities
- `com.apogames.settler.backend.io` — save / checkpoint persistence

App identifiers:

- Android application ID: `com.apogames.tiwanaku`
- Java package namespace: `com.apogames.settler`

### Building and Running

Requires a JDK 11+ and, for the Android build, an Android SDK (set via `local.properties` or `ANDROID_HOME`).

**Desktop**
```bash
./gradlew desktop:run
```

**Android (install & launch on a connected device)**
```bash
./gradlew android:installDebug android:run
```

**Web (TeaVM)**
Build the static site into `teavm/build/dist`:
```bash
./gradlew teavm:build
```
The `TeaVMBuilder` main class can also start a local Jetty server (`--serve`) for development. The currently published web build is in `docs/` and can be served directly.

### Signing the Android Release

The Android release build is signed via Gradle properties. Provide them in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or on the command line:

- `SETTLER_KEYSTORE_PATH`
- `SETTLER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `SETTLER_KEY_ALIAS` (defaults to `settler`)
- `SETTLER_KEY_PASSWORD`

Then run:
```bash
./gradlew android:assembleRelease
```
